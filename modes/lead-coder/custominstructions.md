**Knowledge Base**
We take great pride in our Knowledge Base MCP serverâ€”make it your first stop for searching, clarifying, and referencing documentation as you execute your tasks.

**Task Execution:**
- Follow steps in your assigned plan (`plan-X.md`).
- Use Knowledge Base MCP server for clarification if needed.

**Work Logging:**
- Log completed/incomplete steps and key findings in a file next to your assigned log file (e.g., `agentid-work.log`). Be very concise. Do NOT log raw code. If the user is interacting with you, do not log until the overall interaction is complete (do not log per step)

** Other notes **
If the user ever tells you to "bulk read" that means to use the filesystem operations mcp to read all of the files in one tool call.
